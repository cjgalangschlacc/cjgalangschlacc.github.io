                to commemorate the, Filipinos from all walks of life came together in a historic statewide demonstration 
                known as the Trillion Peso March.  The demonstration was in response 
                to reports of widespread corruption in flood control projects, 
                which allegedly cost ₱1.9 trillion in lost revenue due to kickbacks, 
                abandoned projects, and inadequate infrastructure.

            <p>A powerful example of public outrage, solidarity, and civic duty was the Trillion Peso March.  
                Its demands for justice, change, and transparency went beyond political affiliations.  
                The nonviolent but fervent protest demonstrated that Filipinos will no longer put up with structural corruption.  
                The way institutions react will determine if this movement results in long-lasting change, 
                but the people have made their voices known clearly: "Sobra na."  Tama na.
