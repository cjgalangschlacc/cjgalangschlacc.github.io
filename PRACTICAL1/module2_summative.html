<h3>WHO IS CORTIS?</h3>
<p>CORTIS (MARTIN, JAMES, JUHOON, SEONGHYEON, and KEONHO) is the first boy band in 6 years to debut under BIGHIT MUSIC, the powerhouse label behind iconic global groups like BTS and TOMORROW X TOGETHER. The name CORTIS is an unconventional mix of six letters drawn from the phrase “COLOR OUTSIDE THE LINES,” reflecting their determination to think beyond the boundaries defined by the world. True to their name, CORTIS is a crew of self-driven creatives who bring raw authenticity to everything they create, from music and choreography to video content. All five members, still in their teens, draw from personal stories to showcase their inimitable creativity across songwriting, composition, performance, and videography. What sets them apart is their collaborative approach: rather than adhering to fixed roles, they work together as co-creators to bring their collective vision to life.</p>
